# Analyzing 311 Complaints Over Damaged Trees and Requests for Tree Planting, as of June 2025

In this repo, I analyze and conduct exploratory data visualization on all NYC 311 complaints related to damaged trees and tree planting from 2010 to June 2025 in Python pandas and R. I adjust by population of NYC zip codes, downloaded from the U.S. Census. I also integrate median income data from the census.
